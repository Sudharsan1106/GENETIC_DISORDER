# GENETIC_DISORDER
its a hackerearth project.
In this project trying to classify certain genetic disorder class and sub disorder class using two models (around 23000rows and 35columns).
Performed EDA beacause dataset have both caterigorical and numerical datas with missing values.
Built a model using Light Gradient Boosting algorithm andimprove the accuracy from 42% to near to 74%
#Genetic.py is the main file 
#pipeline.py and classifiers.py are sub file which contains generalised function code format for runing the main file
